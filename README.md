# display data using frontend only

#javascript is used to read the files and insert data


#For a true file overwrite and save, you would need server-side scripting.

"""
For security reasons, web browsers do not allow direct file system access beyond what the user explicitly provides.
This means that you cannot read from or write to arbitrary files on the server without some form of backend handling.
However, we can achieve a similar effect using the HTML5 FileReader API to read and display files, and localStorage to simulate file persistence.
